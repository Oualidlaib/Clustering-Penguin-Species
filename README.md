## Clustering Penguine Species
This mini-project aims to determine how many types of penguins exist in Antarctica based on their physical characteristics, using an unsupervised learning model.

### Dataset Description
The dataset contains information about individual penguins, with the following features:
- `culmen length (mm)`
- `culmen depth (mm)`
- `flipper length (mm)`
- `body mass (g)`
- `penguine sex`
